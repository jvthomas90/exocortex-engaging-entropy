# exocortex-engaging-entropy
Intensive 1.2 project.

## What is this?

This is a mock-up design for a launch page of a product called _Exo-cortex._ It's supposed to help you plan and prioritize better, remember what you need to do when you need to do it, et cetera, **#harder #better #faster #stronger**

## Why did you go this route?

In my proposal doc for this intensive period, I wrote that I'd make a website called _Engaging Entropy_ that would gather all sorts of fun facts, figures, tips, tricks and techniques related to productivity and host it all on one site (categorized, of course, but still - essentially just one giant data dump of "useful" links). 

Partway through working on this though I realize I had probably overscoped. So I dusted off the name of the python project I had undertaken during intensive 1 (i.e. Exo - a to-do list application) and made it the product being touted by Engaging Entropy, a company that apparently specializes in productivity-oriented software. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### How did you make this?

While Github says the tech-stack is 100% HTML, that's not entirely true. In the end, I found it simpler to toss in my CSS and javascript into index file for the site, that's all. As for the specific techniques at play here, the HTML utilizes Bootstrap to make my site look all super fancy, plus I flex a little (*cough* no flexbox, really... please pardon the pun) with some custom styling on top of that, and alas - the creme-de-la-creme, the piece-de-resistance - I utilize the RoughNotation library to animate highlights and annotatations into existence. Pretty nifty, huh? I thought so!
